      <p>
        The Doors of Durin, also known as the West-gate of Moria, are not just a
        doorway but a symbol of ancient friendship and mystery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Carved into the side of the Misty Mountains, these doors served as a
        passage between the Dwarves of Khazad-dum and the Elves of Eregion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Invisible to the eye unless touched by the light of the moon or stars,
        these gates guard one of Middle-earth's greatest secrets.

      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        The doors were constructed during the Second Age by the Dwarves of
        Khazad-dum in collaboration with the Elves of Eregion.The doors were
        intended to serve as a passage between the two allied realms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The doors are unique in that they were made of ithildin, a substance
        that could only be seen by starlight or moonlight, and were inscribed
        with Elvish runes that spelled out the famous riddle: "Speak, friend,
        and enter."

            Made from mithril, ithildin is a magical substance that only reveals
            itself in the light of the moon and stars. It reflects the ancient

            The inscription reads "Ennyn Durin Aran Moria: Pedo mellon a minno"
            which translates to "The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria. Speak,

            Unlike conventional doors, the Doors of Durin can only be opened by
            speaking the Elvish word for "friend"-a riddle that has puzzled many
            over the ages.

      <p>
        The Doors of Durin have storied history in Middle-earth, but they are
        perhaps best known for their role in *The Lord of the Rings*. When the
        Fellowship of the Ring arrived at the West-gate, Gandalf was initially
        stumped by the riddle inscripted on the door.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was only after much contemplation that he realized the simplicity of
        the solution: the Elvish word "mellon" (friend) was the key. The moment
        the word was spoken, the doors opened, revealed the dark passage into
        Moria.

          <p>Establishment of Eregion and the forging of the Rings of Power
            The whereabouts of Celebrimbor during the early years of the Second Age are uncertain, but at some point, he became a great friend to Galadriel and Celeborn,[1] and in S.A. 750,[9] Celebrimbor with many others of the exiled Noldor followed them to establish the realm of Eregion near to Khazad-dûm, the mansions of the Longbeard Dwarves. This they did due to the discovery of mithril in the surrounding mountains.[10]
            
            Eventually, a great friendship arose between the Elves of Eregion and the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, such that was never before seen, and Celebrimbor became the Lord of Eregion[10] and the greatest of the Gwaith-i-Mírdain, "People of the Jewel-smiths", who in their skill were second only to Fëanor, Celebrimbor's grandfather. There, Celebrimbor befriended Narvi the Dwarf,[11] who built the Doors of Durin, and Celebrimbor inscribed the words upon it.[12]
            
            However, in S.A. 1200, Sauron, under the fair guise of Annatar, came to Eriador posing as an emissary of the Valar. He was rejected by Gil-galad, the High King of the Noldor, in Lindon (where he was not even admitted to), but although Galadriel did not trust him and treated him with scorn, he was nonetheless accepted by the smiths of Eregion, for Celebrimbor desired in his heart to rival the skill and fame of Fëanor. Galadriel and Celeborn were eventually stripped of their authority in Eregion, and this was largely due to the machinations of Sauron. Galadriel, with her daughter Celebrían, departed for the Elvish realm of Lórien, while Celeborn, due to his dislike of all Dwarves and not wanting to cross through their mansions in Khazad-dûm, remained behind in Eregion, and he was largely ignored by Celebrimbor and Annatar thereafter.[11]

            The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
An alternate Celebrimbor is a secondary character in Amazon Studios' series The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, portrayed by Charles Edwards.

Celebrimbor is first seen introduced to Elrond by Gil-galad in Lindon; already a master artisan. Elrond accompanies Celebrimbor back to Ost-in-Edhil, in Eregion, where Celebrimbor shows him his grandfather Fëanor's hammer, and tells him of his own desire to create something truly significant. This requires a forge greater than any yet built; one which the Elves have not the ability to make. Elrond, because of his friendship with the Dwarf-prince Durin IV, volunteers to attempt forging an alliance between Eregion and Khazad-dûm. Celebrimbor walks with Elrond to Khazad-dûm's West-gate, but Elrond ventures in alone.

Elrond eventually is able to negotiate an agreement with Durin IV and his father, Durin III, and work on the proposed forge soon begins. Upon Elrond's return to Ost-in-Edhil, Celebrimbor remarks on Elrond's likeness to his father Eärendil, and how Eärendil once foresaw Celebrimbor's fate to lie in Elrond's hands one day. The two then realize that Durin IV
