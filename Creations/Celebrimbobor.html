      <p>
        The Doors of Durin, also known as the West-gate of Moria, are not just a
        doorway but a symbol of ancient friendship and mystery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Carved into the side of the Misty Mountains, these doors served as a
        passage between the Dwarves of Khazad-dum and the Elves of Eregion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Invisible to the eye unless touched by the light of the moon or stars,
        these gates guard one of Middle-earth's greatest secrets.

      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        The doors were constructed during the Second Age by the Dwarves of
        Khazad-dum in collaboration with the Elves of Eregion.The doors were
        intended to serve as a passage between the two allied realms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The doors are unique in that they were made of ithildin, a substance
        that could only be seen by starlight or moonlight, and were inscribed
        with Elvish runes that spelled out the famous riddle: "Speak, friend,
        and enter."

          <h3>Ithildin Glow</h3>
          <p>
            Made from mithril, ithildin is a magical substance that only reveals
            itself in the light of the moon and stars. It reflects the ancient
            bond between Dwarves and Elves

          <h3>Elvish Inscription</h3>
          <p>
            The inscription reads "Ennyn Durin Aran Moria: Pedo mellon a minno"
            which translates to "The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria. Speak,
            friend, and enter

          <h3>Enigmatic Mechanism</h3>
          <p>
            Unlike conventional doors, the Doors of Durin can only be opened by
            speaking the Elvish word for "friend"-a riddle that has puzzled many
            over the ages.

      <p>
        The Doors of Durin have storied history in Middle-earth, but they are
        perhaps best known for their role in *The Lord of the Rings*. When the
        Fellowship of the Ring arrived at the West-gate, Gandalf was initially
        stumped by the riddle inscripted on the door.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was only after much contemplation that he realized the simplicity of
        the solution: the Elvish word "mellon" (friend) was the key. The moment
        the word was spoken, the doors opened, revealed the dark passage into
        Moria.
