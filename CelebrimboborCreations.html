    <p>The Doors of Durin, also known as the West-gate of Moria, are not just a doorway but a symbol of ancient friendship and mystery.</p>
    <p>Carved into the side of the Misty Mountains, these doors served as a passage between the Dwarves of Khazad-dum and the Elves of Eregion.</p>
    <p>Invisible to the eye unless touched by the light of the moon or stars, these gates guard one of Middle-earth's greatest secrets.</p>

      <img src="History of Durin.jpg" alt="Historical Depiction of the Doors of Durin" class="feature-image">
      <p>The construction of the Doors of Durin dates back to the Second Age when the Dwarves of Khazad-dum, led by Durin III, collaborated with the Elves of Eregion.</p>
      <p>Celebrimbor, the Elven smith, crafted the ithildin inscription that decorate the door.</p>
      <p>The Doors symbolize the strong friendship between Dwarves and Elves before the dark times.</p>
      <p>But when Khazad-dum fell under the shadow of Durin's Bane, the doors were shut, and their secrets were lostto time.</p>

        <h3>Ithildin Glow</h3>
        <p>Made from mithril, ithildin is a magical substance that only reveals itself in the light of the moon and stars. It reflects the ancient bond between Dwarves and Elves</p>

        <h3>Elvish Inscription</h3>
        <p>The inscription reads "Ennyn Durin Aran Moria: Pedo mellon a minno" which translates to "The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria. Speak, friend, and enter</p>

          <h3>Enigmatic Mechanism</h3>
          <p>Unlike conventional doors, the Doors of Durin can only be opened by speaking the Elvish word for "friend"-a riddle that has puzzled many over the ages.</p>

      <h2>Legend and Lore</h2>
     <img src="Doors.jpg" alt="The Fellowship at the Doors of Durin" class="feature-image">
     <p>The Doors of Durin have storied history in Middle-earth, but they are perhaps best known for their role in *The Lord of the Rings*. When the Fellowship of the Ring arrived at the West-gate, Gandalf was initially stumped by the riddle inscripted on the door.</p>
     <p>It was only after much contemplation that he realized the simplicity of the solution: the Elvish word "mellon" (friend) was the key. The moment the word was spoken, the doors opened, revealed the dark passage into Moria.</p>
