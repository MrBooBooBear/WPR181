          <p>Establishment of Eregion and the forging of the Rings of Power
            The whereabouts of Celebrimbor during the early years of the Second Age are uncertain, but at some point, he became a great friend to Galadriel and Celeborn,[1] and in S.A. 750,[9] Celebrimbor with many others of the exiled Noldor followed them to establish the realm of Eregion near to Khazad-dûm, the mansions of the Longbeard Dwarves. This they did due to the discovery of mithril in the surrounding mountains.[10]
            
            Eventually, a great friendship arose between the Elves of Eregion and the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, such that was never before seen, and Celebrimbor became the Lord of Eregion[10] and the greatest of the Gwaith-i-Mírdain, "People of the Jewel-smiths", who in their skill were second only to Fëanor, Celebrimbor's grandfather. There, Celebrimbor befriended Narvi the Dwarf,[11] who built the Doors of Durin, and Celebrimbor inscribed the words upon it.[12]
            
            However, in S.A. 1200, Sauron, under the fair guise of Annatar, came to Eriador posing as an emissary of the Valar. He was rejected by Gil-galad, the High King of the Noldor, in Lindon (where he was not even admitted to), but although Galadriel did not trust him and treated him with scorn, he was nonetheless accepted by the smiths of Eregion, for Celebrimbor desired in his heart to rival the skill and fame of Fëanor. Galadriel and Celeborn were eventually stripped of their authority in Eregion, and this was largely due to the machinations of Sauron. Galadriel, with her daughter Celebrían, departed for the Elvish realm of Lórien, while Celeborn, due to his dislike of all Dwarves and not wanting to cross through their mansions in Khazad-dûm, remained behind in Eregion, and he was largely ignored by Celebrimbor and Annatar thereafter.[11]

            In c. S.A. 1500, the Gwaith-i-Mírdain reached the height of their skill under the instruction of Sauron and began forging the Rings of Power.
            The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
An alternate Celebrimbor is a secondary character in Amazon Studios' series The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, portrayed by Charles Edwards.

Celebrimbor is first seen introduced to Elrond by Gil-galad in Lindon; already a master artisan. Elrond accompanies Celebrimbor back to Ost-in-Edhil, in Eregion, where Celebrimbor shows him his grandfather Fëanor's hammer, and tells him of his own desire to create something truly significant. This requires a forge greater than any yet built; one which the Elves have not the ability to make. Elrond, because of his friendship with the Dwarf-prince Durin IV, volunteers to attempt forging an alliance between Eregion and Khazad-dûm. Celebrimbor walks with Elrond to Khazad-dûm's West-gate, but Elrond ventures in alone.

Elrond eventually is able to negotiate an agreement with Durin IV and his father, Durin III, and work on the proposed forge soon begins. Upon Elrond's return to Ost-in-Edhil, Celebrimbor remarks on Elrond's likeness to his father Eärendil, and how Eärendil once foresaw Celebrimbor's fate to lie in Elrond's hands one day. The two then realize that Durin IV
