      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        The Doors of Durin, also known as the West-gate or the West-door of
        Moria, are an iconic enterance to the ancient Dwarven kingdom of
        Khazad-dum (later known as Moria) in J.R.R Tolkien's Middle-earth.

      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        The doors were constructed during the Second Age by the Dwarves of
        Khazad-dum in collaboration with the Elves of Eregion.The doors were
        intended to serve as a passage between the two allied realms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The doors are unique in that they were made of ithildin, a substance
        that could only be seen by starlight or moonlight, and were inscribed
        with Elvish runes that spelled out the famous riddle: "Speak, friend,
        and enter."

        The Doors of Durin played a significant role in the journey of the
