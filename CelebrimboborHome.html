      <h1 id="mainTextHeader">First-age</h1>
      <p id="mainText">Celebrimbor was born in Aman during the Years of the Trees. Among Fëanor's seven sons, Celebrimbor's father Curufin was the chief inheritor of Fëanor's temperament and skills in craftsmanship. In turn, Curufin passed these skills – but not this temper – on to Celebrimbor.</p> <br>
      <p id="mainText">Following the Darkening of Valinor, Celebrimbor followed Fëanor into exile in Middle-earth. His unnamed mother remained behind with the people of Finarfin. Celebrimbor did not swear the Oath of Fëanor. It is unknown whether he took part in the Kinslaying at Alqualondë. It is also unknown whether he crossed the Belegaer in one of the stolen Falmari ships or if he followed Fingolfin across the Helcaraxë.</p> <br>
      <p id="mainText">Celebrimbor's whereabouts in Beleriand in the early Years of the Sun are unattested, but later events suggest that he dwelt with his father Curufin and uncle Celegorm in their realm of Himlad. The realm lasted until the Dagor Bragollach in F.A. 455, in which Morgoth broke the Siege of Angband. After this defeat, Curufin and Celegorm fled to the southwest with many of their people, including Celebrimbor, and took refuge with Finrod Felagund in his realm of Nargothrond.</p> <br>
      <p id="mainText">Though they were but refugees and guests in Nargothrond, Curufin and Celegorm sought power, and they quickly gained great influence among the people. For his part, Celebrimbor was not involved in his father's schemes and came to love Finrod.</p>  <br>
      <p id="mainText">In F.A. 465, the brothers' political machinations forced Finrod to surrender his crown to Orodreth and leave his realm. Their dominance would prove short-lived. Later that same year, captives freed from the dungeons of Tol-in-Gaurhoth returned to Nargothrond and spoke against the brothers, revealing their treachery and turning the people against them. Orodreth would not suffer them to be slain and so exiled them from the realm.</p> <br>
      <p id="mainText">When Celebrimbor learned the truth of his father and uncle's actions, he was "aghast" and parted ways with them. He was not subject to their exile and did not voluntarily follow them. His whereabouts for the remainder of the First Age are unknown.</p> <br>

      <h1 id="mainTextHeader">Second-Age</h1>
      <h4 id="mainTextHeader">Establishment of Eregion and the forging of the Rings of Power</h4>
      <p id="mainText">The whereabouts of Celebrimbor during the early years of the Second Age are uncertain, but at some point, he became a great friend to Galadriel and Celeborn, and in S.A. 750, Celebrimbor with many others of the exiled Noldor followed them to establish the realm of Eregion near to Khazad-dûm, the mansions of the Longbeard Dwarves. This they did due to the discovery of mithril in the surrounding mountains.</p> <br>
      <p id="mainText">Eventually, a great friendship arose between the Elves of Eregion and the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, such that was never before seen, and Celebrimbor became the Lord of Eregion and the greatest of the Gwaith-i-Mírdain, "People of the Jewel-smiths", who in their skill were second only to Fëanor, Celebrimbor's grandfather. There, Celebrimbor befriended Narvi the Dwarf, who built the Doors of Durin, and Celebrimbor inscribed the words upon it.</p> <br>
      <p id="mainText">However, in S.A. 1200, Sauron, under the fair guise of Annatar, came to Eriador posing as an emissary of the Valar. He was rejected by Gil-galad, the High King of the Noldor, in Lindon (where he was not even admitted to), but although Galadriel did not trust him and treated him with scorn, he was nonetheless accepted by the smiths of Eregion, for Celebrimbor desired in his heart to rival the skill and fame of Fëanor. Galadriel and Celeborn were eventually stripped of their authority in Eregion, and this was largely due to the machinations of Sauron. Galadriel, with her daughter Celebrían, departed for the Elvish realm of Lórien, while Celeborn, due to his dislike of all Dwarves and not wanting to cross through their mansions in Khazad-dûm, remained behind in Eregion, and he was largely ignored by Celebrimbor and Annatar thereafter.</p> <br>
      <p id="mainText">In c. S.A. 1500, the Gwaith-i-Mírdain reached the height of their skill under the instruction of Sauron and began forging the Rings of Power. </p> <br>
      <h4 id="mainTextHeader">The War of the Elves and Sauron and death</h4>
      <p id="mainText">Celebrimbor was ignorant of Sauron's true intentions, and he was unaware that Sauron had incorporated a binding magic into the rings. Furthermore, in secret, Sauron forged the One Ring, a master ring that would rule all the lesser rings, to enable him to rule Middle-earth by controlling those that wore all the other rings. When Sauron placed the One Ring on his finger, claiming dominance over all the Rings of Power and their bearers, the Elves knew his true identity and intentions. Celebrimbor and the Elves of Eregion defied Sauron by withholding the other rings from him. Aside from the One Ring, the greatest rings were created by Celebrimbor himself, and these were never touched by Sauron and thus were uncorrupted by him, although they were still subject to the One Ring. These were the Three Rings of the Elves, and a chief source of the beauty that came about in the Third Age. Celebrimbor named them Vilya, Narya, and Nenya after the Middle-earth elements of air, fire and water. He sent the three rings to Elf-lords for safekeeping: Vilya and Narya to Gil-galad in Lindon; and Nenya to Galadriel. Celebrimbor also sent the mightiest of the seven to Durin III of Khazad-dûm.</p> <br>
      <p id="mainText">Sauron retaliated by attacking Eregion, laying waste to the realm. Celebrimbor was captured in the chaos and was forced, under torture, to disclose the locations of the lesser rings, but he would not reveal the whereabouts of the Three. Celebrimbor died from his torment, and his body was shot with arrows and hung upon a pole, and was later paraded as a banner when Sauron attacked the Grey Havens.</p>
